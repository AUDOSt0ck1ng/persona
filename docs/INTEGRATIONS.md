# Persona integrations

Persona accepts small state and level messages from local voice experiences.
The character renderer never needs raw audio, transcripts, prompts, credentials,
or host-application internals.

The bundled Codex and ChatGPT integration uses native process-scoped output
listeners because those applications do not currently expose a supported
cross-process realtime voice event stream. If an official event stream becomes
available, it can map to the same contract without changing Persona's window or
animation system.

## Automatic listeners

### Linux

Persona polls the PipeWire graph for a Codex or ChatGPT playback node. It
attaches `pw-record` to that one stream, calculates RMS amplitude in memory, and
discards every sample after calculation. The stream remains connected to its
normal output device.

### Windows

The native helper uses WASAPI application loopback with
`PROCESS_LOOPBACK_MODE_INCLUDE_TARGET_PROCESS_TREE`. Audio from other
applications is excluded. Persona supports Windows 10 build 20348 and newer.

### macOS

The native helper creates a private, unmuted Core Audio process tap and private
aggregate device for the selected voice process. Persona supports macOS 14.2
and newer and declares why it requests System Audio Recording permission.

Set `PERSONA_TARGET_PROCESS_PATTERN` to a case-insensitive regular expression
to target another desktop voice application:

```bash
PERSONA_TARGET_PROCESS_PATTERN='my-voice-app' persona
```

## URL protocol

Installed packages register `persona://`.

| URL | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `persona://show` | Show and focus Persona |
| `persona://hide` | Hide Persona without quitting |
| `persona://toggle` | Toggle visibility |
| `persona://listening` | Begin a listening state |
| `persona://thinking` | Settle the character while a response is prepared |
| `persona://speaking?level=0.3` | Begin speaking and optionally set a level |
| `persona://inactive` | End the voice state without hiding Persona |
| `persona://greeting` | Preview the greeting motion |
| `persona://celebrate` | Preview a celebration motion |
| `persona://dance` | Preview a dance motion |

Open these URLs with `xdg-open` on Linux, `open` on macOS, or `start` on
Windows.

## Loopback HTTP API

Persona listens on `127.0.0.1:47831` by default. Override the port with
`PERSONA_BRIDGE_PORT`. Native clients may omit `Origin`; browser clients are
restricted to trusted local and supported app origins.

Voice state:

```json
{
  "type": "state",
  "state": {
    "phase": "active",
    "activity": "speaking",
    "microphoneMuted": false,
    "outputMuted": false
  }
}
```

Allowed phases are `inactive`, `starting`, `active`, and `stopping`. Allowed
activities are `idle`, `listening`, and `speaking`.

Normalized level:

```json
{
  "type": "audio-level",
  "level": 0.31
}
```

Animation preview:

```json
{
  "type": "animation",
  "animation": "DANCE"
}
```

Allowed animations are `IDLE`, `GREETING`, `TALK`, `CELEBRATE`, and `DANCE`.

Send events:

```bash
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"type":"state","state":{"phase":"active","activity":"speaking","microphoneMuted":false,"outputMuted":false}}' \
  http://127.0.0.1:47831/events
```

`GET /health` reports whether Persona is running and returns the last state. It
does not expose user content.
